	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on designing an online credit card fraud detection framework with big data technologies, by which we want to achieve three major goals: 1) the ability to fuse multiple detection models to improve accuracy; 2) the ability to process large amount of data and 3) the ability to do the detection in real time. To accomplish that, we propose a general workﬂow, which satisﬁes most design ideas of current credit card fraud detection systems. We further implement the workﬂow with a new framework which consists of four layers: distributed storage layer, batch training layer, key-value sharing layer and streaming detection layer. With the four layers, we are able to support massive trading data storage, fast detection model training, quick model data sharing and real-time online fraud detection, respectively. We implement it with latest big data technologies like Hadoop, Spark, Storm, HBase, etc. A prototype is implemented and tested with a synthetic dataset, which shows great potentials of achieving the above goals.},

In this paper, we analyze the various forms of fraud to which are exposed banks d data mining tools allowing its early detection data already accumulated in a bank. We use supervised learning methods Support Vector Machines with Spark (SVM-S) to build models representing normal and abnormal customer behavior and then use it to evaluate validity of new transactions. The results obtained from databases of credit card transactions show that these techniques are effective in the fight against banking fraud in big data. Experiment result from the study show that SVM-S have better prediction performance than Back Propagation Networks (BPN). Besides the average prediction, accuracy reaches a maximum when training the data ratio arrives at 0.8.},

	abstract = {Frauds have no constant patterns. They always change their behavior; so, we need to use an unsupervised learning. Fraudsters learn about new technology that allows them to execute frauds through online transactions. Fraudsters assume the regular behavior of consumers, and fraud patterns change fast. So, fraud detection systems need to detect online transactions by using unsupervised learning, because some fraudsters commit frauds once through online mediums and then switch to other techniques. This paper aims to 1) focus on fraud cases that cannot be detected based on previous history or supervised learning, 2) create a model of deep Auto-encoder and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that can reconstruct normal transactions to find anomalies from normal patterns. The proposed deep learning based on auto-encoder (AE) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that applies backpropagation by setting the inputs equal to the outputs. The RBM has two layers, the input layer (visible) and hidden layer. In this research, we use the Tensorflow library from Google to implement AE, RBM, and H2O by using deep learning. The results show the mean squared error, root mean squared error, and area under curve.},

	abstract = {Credit card fraud detection is an important study in the current era of mobile payment. Improving the performance of a fraud detection model and keeping its stability are very challenging because users’ payment behaviors and criminals’ fraud behaviors are often changing. In this article, we focus on obtaining deep feature representations of legal and fraud transactions from the aspect of the loss function of a deep neural network. Our purpose is to obtain better separability and discrimination of features so that it can improve the performance of our fraud detection model and keep its stability. We propose a new kind of loss function, full center loss (FCL), which considers both distances and angles among features and, thus, can comprehensively supervise the deep representation learning. We conduct lots of experiments on two big data sets of credit card transactions, one is private and another is public, to demonstrate the detection performance of our model by comparing FCL with other state-of-the-art loss functions. The results illustrate that FCL outperforms others. We also conduct experiments to show that FCL can ensure a more stable model than others.},

	abstract = {With the exponential increase in the usage of the internet, numerous organisations, including the financial industry, have operationalized online services. The massive financial losses occur as a result of the global growth in financial fraud. Henceforth, devising advanced financial fraud detection systems can actively detect the risks such as illegal transactions and irregular attacks. Over the recent years, these issues are tackled to a larger extent by means of data mining and machine learning techniques. However, in terms of unknown attack pattern identification, big data analytics and speed computation, several improvements must be performed in these techniques. The Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) scheme based financial fraud detection scheme using deep learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. When large volume of data is involved, the detection accuracy can be enhanced by using this technique. The existing machine learning models, auto-encoder model and other deep learning models are compared with the proposed model to evaluate the performance by using a real-time credit card fraud dataset. Over a time duration of 45 seconds, a detection accuracy of 99\% has been obtained by using the proposed model as observed in the experimental results.},

	abstract = {With the rise of the internet and online shopping, the use of credit cards for online purchases skyrocketed and so did the incidents of online ﬁnancial frauds. In the year 2018 alone, 24.26 Billion USD was lost worldwide due to credit card frauds. As a result of these frauds, many innocent people have lost a lot of their earnings which discouraged them from ever taking part in online payment activities. The most common victims of such frauds are people in old age as they are less tech-savvy. Traditionally machine learning and deep learning approaches to credit card fraud detection have been around supervised learning methods but supervised learning methods always have to rely on labelled datasets which means that they need to get prior ideas about what type of transaction is considered fraud before giving predictions on other transactions. Some recent work has been done on fraud detection using unsupervised learning. In this work, we analyze the performance of unsupervised learning techniques such as k-means clustering on a credit card fraud detection dataset. We also try to further the research in this area by proposing a Particle swarm optimization and k-means clustering hybrid model for the same. The model based on our proposed approach has improved the performance of kmeans clustering approach. Our Hybrid approach has shown better accuracy, precision, and recall than the k-means clustering approach.},

In the fraud detection task, typically the available datasets for ML training present some peculiarities, such as the unavoidable condition of a strong class imbalance, the existence of unlabeled transactions, and the large number of records that must be processed. The present paper aims to propose a methodology for automatic detection of fraudulent transactions, that tackle all these problems. The methodology is based on a Balanced Random Forest, that can be used in supervised and semi-supervised scenarios through a co-training approach. Two different schemes for the co-training approach are tested, in order to overcome the class imbalance problem. Moreover, a Spark platform and Hadoop ﬁle system support our solution, in order to enable the scalability of the proposed solution. The proposed approach achieves an absolute improvement of around 24\% in terms of geometric mean in comparison to a standard random forest learning strategy.},
